To get access to the repo, just dm me and ask for commit permissions. This repository exists to let everyone have access to the projects we're working on at all times and places.

If someone screws with your project and you want to get the old version back, go on the website, and under commits, you'll see all versions that have previously been uploaded, so you can easily recover lost code or files.

The LawnMowerRPG directory stores the unity project for our LawnMower game.
The CNCMachine directory stores the files for the CNC Project
The Learners directory is for people who are learning how to program

Have fun and do some computer stuff.
